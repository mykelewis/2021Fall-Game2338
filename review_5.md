## Summary
Fire Emblem: Awakening is a turn-based stratagey RPG. It was released Feburary 3, 2013 by Nintendo for the 3DS. It features the player playing as the *tactitian*, male or fecmale,
who leads a group of hero to fight the forces of evil.

The game starts in a fearsome losing battle with a dragon before a flash of white light sends the player back in time to try it all over again. The player must gather up their
party again to try and make a more favorable future. The controls are rather simply with the player positioning the heros across the tiled battle field to fight through hordes of 
enemies.

The story in wonderful, and without too many spoilers, it ends resoundingly well. The characters are loveable and the interaction between the mare memorable.

## Final Thoughts

I've played this game back when I was in middle school. It was fun and entertaining with how many times I've played it over and over again. I'd reccomend even playing this game 
today. The graphics maye be a bit dated but it's very much still worth the time despite my personal nostalgia.
