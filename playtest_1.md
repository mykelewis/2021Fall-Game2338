**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ Everything was wonderfully explaing in the tutorial level. The controls, the enemies, and the objective.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ There were a couple of areas in levels that didn't make sense, such as a jungle gym to the left when the player is ment to go to the right. It was a wast of space and confused me for a while.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game seenes to lean towards the platforming audience. those that loved *Mirrors Edge* and *Super Hot*. So far it looks fun but the enemies are more annoyances rather that obstacles. I feel like they need to be a bit tougher to make the game more challanging and rewarding.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The timing is great so far. Each level has an end and most of the time when you find the prefered path you could run through the level in less than a minute.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ In the game there a grappling hook that goes fantastically with the sliding mechanic. It's wonderful for building speed and breezing through levels

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ While I got frustrated a couple of times in the end I did have fun with the game.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The major issue I hade was the wall jump mechanic. It one of the major movements in this game but there are times when I jumped from the wall without wanting to. Another issue I found was the speed mechanic was often punished rather than utilized. If you were going too fast you would ofted slip and slid right off the map.
