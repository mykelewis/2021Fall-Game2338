## Summary

Small Saga is a isometric fantasy rpg where a pair of mice set out into the sewers to find food for their community. The graphice are gorgeous, although a little flat in some areas. On the way they encounter hungry rats and angry gods. As of now it is currently incomplete but it shows a lot of promise. The current lore provided is rich with what little there is. 

As for controls and general gameplay, I would say it's rather polished. Aside from a small hiccup in the main menu everything works as intended. Personally I don't like movement in isometric that isn't point-and-click. Having to mostly hold down two keys to move 'straight' is uncomfortable. Aside from that the controls are sleek and the UI is easy to understand. 

## Final Thoughts

All in all this game is a joy to play. It's fun, cute, and unique. Aside from my personal vendetta from non point-and-click this game is well made and has the potential to be great once it's finished.
