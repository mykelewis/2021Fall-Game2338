#### Overwatch
  :full_moon::full_moon::full_moon::last_quarter_moon::new_moon:
  
  At first Overwatch was a revelutionary game for it's genre. It implemented features such as special powers and firearms to certain characters akin to that of a MOBA game.
  the gameplay was fluid and underneath the surface the lore was rich and entertaining. However a couple years after the initial release there were a lot of changes implemented to
  some characters making them either weaker or overpowered. There was a strong team dynamic that was impossible to break regardless of skill. This made the game dull and repetetive,
  and eventually players such as myself just lost interest. I still believe it's a good game and I come back ot it once in a while but it's lost its hype for me.

#### Smash Bros Ultimate
   :full_moon::full_moon::last_quarter_moon::new_moon::new_moon:
  
  I personally don't like fighter games. The most skills they allow is button mashing and it's jsut boring. I horever manages to find some enjoymeny in Smash bros from the interesting
  variety of characters to the variety of playstyles. Howeveer the more serious I got with the game the more I foudn it was again anther button masher. I do understand the appeal of the game
  and it's always interesting to watch other people play it as well as play with friends.
  
#### Minecraft
   :full_moon::full_moon::full_moon::full_moon::full_moon:
   
   Minecraft was a game changer to the indie development industry. It was a simple idea that became extremely replayable and customizable. One person cannot have the exact same experience
   when playing this game. That's only with the original game. One cound play this game fore a lime time in just vanilla Minecraft. The art while simple is beautiful, the world randomly 
   created are breath taking, and the stories player's can make are ungforgettable. In fact, Minecraft solely relies on it's ever expanding player base to remain interesting and new. 
   From new updates from developers, to mods and custom data pack fro mthe community itself. One could play this game everyday for years and still find something new to do if they put their
   mind to it.
