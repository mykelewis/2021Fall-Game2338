## Summary
Harvest Moon DS: Cute is a farming simulator RPG that takes playe in Forget-Me-Not-Valley. The player, a young woman, moves into the valley to continue their grandfather's farm. The player has to tidy up the old farm while helping the Harvest godess return to her rightful place.

This game is pretty old school with controls akin to that of the Gameboy. There's very little freedon withing the game other than the player being alowed to change their outfit and the interior look of their house. One of the main quest, finding all the sprites, is quite tedious and unclear. There's no real book to tell how to acheive all the sprites, the player simply has to play the game and hope they run into one.

Another issue tended to be the lack of content towards the late game. Once you get married and returned the goddess to her throne there isn't much to do afterwards. The player is simply ment to farm for the rest of the game or until they get bored.

## Final Thoughts

While this game will always hold a special place in my heart I do understand it came with a lot a problems. For instance lack of freedom for the player to decorate their form or choose their gender. To do so you would need to purchase an entierly different game. There was also a section of the game that you simple couldn't accsess unless you have a Gameboy and a previous installation of the game. Another grip was the sprites, again there was no insrtuctions on where to find them and there were more sprites than were needed for the main quest. The game is fun in the beginning but torawds the end once you've gotten married there isn't much to do other than twiddle your thumbs.
