## Summary

Stardew Valley is a simple farming game about a farmer who inherits their grandfathers farm and moves to Stardew Valley to start anew. The player is allowed ot customize their farm, plant various beautiful crops and befriend the townfolks. There's plenty of mysteries and secrets hidden in the game from the depths of the mines to the newly implemented island system. 

The mechanic of this game is similar to that of old school Harvest Moon games. It is a top down pixel games with very limited movement options. Only recently were things as simple as sitting on a chair were added to updates adding a bit more charm and immersion to the game. The player's main income arrive from 6 seperate activities: Farming, Animal Husbandry, Foraging, Mining, Fishing, and Artisian Goods. Out of all the activities fishing seems to be the most tedious among players.

Without giving much spoilers the game manages to fufil the desire of wonder and curiousity with all the little hints it manages to leave at each an ever turn.
## Final Thoughts

My final thoughts about this game is that it's quite possible a masterpeice of it's age and deserves to be enjoyed by those that enjoy this genre of game. Despite some of the tasks being tedious, such as fishing, it doesn't take away from the beauty and charm of the game for a second. Stardew Valley have brought back a simple joy and nostolgia one feels with those old school 8-bit games while still giving it a new fresh taste making it enjoyable for all audiences.
