## Summary

This is a battle royale game based of the hit TV series Squid Game. In the game a set number of players, anywhere from 15-100, compete to be the last player standing. The game also includes proximity chat so the player may either stratigieze with or against other players.

The graphiccs are very basic, akin to that of a students 3D game project. The controls aren't much better they're a bit wonky at times where I would press control to crouch but there would be a delay. Other times when I'm spriting I won't accelerate as quickly as I should.

This doesn't even begin to touch on the player base and how little filter there is I've encountered a lot of lobbies. There are countless lobbies filled with people slinging slurs and such and theres no report system to deal with these problematic players.

## Final Thoughts
Aside from all the issues the game is fun to play with friends and people who tend to ban more toxic players. I would hope that this game continues to be developed and a lot of the glaring issues fixed over time.
