## Summary

Apex Legends is a FPS battle royale game based across three different maps. In this FPS the player is teamed up with two other players and given an assortment of collorful
characters called **Legends**. Together they must scavange items strew across the map and battle their was through other teams until they become the last team standing.

As mentioned before the player is able to chose from a list of Legends. Each Legend comes with their own special set of abilities that give them an edge during the battle.
Depending on the abilities they come with they're separated into the catagories of offensive, defensive, support, and recon. 

Offensive characters are fast, agile, and tend to deal a good set of damage. Defensive characters usually come with their own shields with some being able to control an area.
Support characters are able to heal the team or easily provide items while in a secure location. Lastly, Recon characters are able to help their team travel across the 
map or provide location info on enemies. There are many combinatiosn of characters and classes that work fantastically leaving the game fresh and entertaining.

## Final Thoughts

The game is wonderful and I reccommend it to all. Aside from some grinding the player has to do to player has to do to unlock most of the charchters it's a fun experience. While
Some abilites are better than others the game mostly relies on the player's skill with aiming, tactics, and positioning. It's a fresh take on the battle royale genre that many
should experience.
